This strain is prone to forming incredibly large flocs unlike any other yeast we've seen before, yet still remains highly attenuative.

We recommend brewing with GB110 in one of three ways.  I)  “Hot Start”:  Pitch GB110 to wort at 98 F with little or no hops for 48-72 hrs.  Wort may be soured before kettle boil or after.  If soured before kettle boil,  boil with hop additions as usual.  If soured after kettle boil cool wort and pitch yeast.  II)  “Co-Pitch”:  Pitch GB110 into a primary with yeast of your choice at 68-72 F.  Wort that is less than 1050 and 7 IBU will typically be very sour in 2-3 weeks.    III)  “Secondary”:  Pitch GB110 after primary fermentation for an aged sour.  Souring by this method typically requires several months.

Incubate 24-48 hours at room temperature to increase cell count. Prepare wort as normal and cool to 75-95F. Pitch lactobacillus starter into unhopped wort and allow to sour to desired level. Maximum levels of sourness should develop within 48 hours. There is no need to hold the temperatures at the high end of the range for effective souring due to the efficient action of plantarum at lower temperatures. When desired sourness is achieved, re-boil wort to kill lactobacillus.  Add hops at this time if desired.  This blend is extremely hop sensitive.  Souring may not occur in worts with 2 or more IBUs.
